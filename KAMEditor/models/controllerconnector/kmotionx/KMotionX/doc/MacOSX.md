###Mac OS X
This is a really nice platform. Almost everything is installed already. Given that you are a developer and have the latest XCode installed.

libftdi is available to OS X in at least to ways where HomeBrew currently provides latest version. 

Install HomeBrew from http://brew.sh
Then install libfdti
```
brew install libftdi
```

Install macports from https://www.macports.org

Then install libfdti.
```
sudo port install libftdi1
```
